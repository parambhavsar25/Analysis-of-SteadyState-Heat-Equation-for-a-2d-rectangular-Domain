# Analysis-of-SteadyState-Heat-Equation-for-a-2d-rectangular-Domain

This Repository Contains Python Code that Solves the Steady State Heat Transfer Equation For a give 2D-Rectangual Mesh Domain. 
Data Entry is really easy and After Each step You get a complete Visualization of the Output.
Mesh domain Size can be tuned as per the requirements of the Accuaracy.
3 Different Graphical Represantations that gives idea about the tanmparatures arround the Mesh,
With the output in the form of a Metrix containing temperatures of all the meshed cells iside the domain.
